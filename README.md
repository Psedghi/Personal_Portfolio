## Parsa Sedghi Final Project Submission
This is my submission for the final project, which includes the following pages: Home, About, Projects, and Contact. I have implemented responsive design for the `Projects` page to make it mobile-friendly.

## Mobile-Friendly Page
I believe that all the pages have been optimized for mobile screens. I adjusted their layouts to change widths based on the size of the screen. A good one to check out would either be the Home page or the Projects page.

## Set up (For my own reference later)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
