## Welcome to my Personal Portfolio :D
This is my personal portfolio page! Welcome and I hope you liked it. I originally made this page when I was in the CMSC398T class where they taught us about accessible design and decided to implement what I learned in class to revamp my portfolio page. The main languages I use is Typescript, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS. This is my first time using this tech stack and I really learned a lot. 


## Mobile-Friendly Page
I believe that all the pages have been optimized for mobile screens. I adjusted their layouts to change widths based on the size of the screen. A good one to check out would either be the 'Home' page or the 'Projects' page.

## References of Packages
- **React Icons**
- **Next.js Navigation**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## Set up (For my own reference later)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
