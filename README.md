## Parsa Sedghi Final Project Submission
This is my submission for the final project, which includes the following pages: Home, About, Projects, and Contact. I have implemented responsive design for all the pages to make it mobile-friendly.


## Mobile-Friendly Page
I believe that all the pages have been optimized for mobile screens. I adjusted their layouts to change widths based on the size of the screen. A good one to check out would either be the 'Home' page or the 'Projects' page.

## Complications/Shortcomings faced

1. **Checkpoint #1 to Final Project**:
   - I improved the alignment and spacing of elements.
   - At first I struggled to make the hover effects and color transitions accessible while adhering to the chosen color scheme. Adjustments were made to ensure readability and contrast.
   - During the development of the mobile-friendly `Projects` page, I faced layout issues where images were too large for smaller screens. I sovled this by adjusting widths using Tailwindâ€™s responsive classes.

2. **Checkpoint #2 to Final Project**:
   - Adding the active state indicator for the current page required transitioning to `usePathname` and marking the component as a Client Component, which introduced dependencies that needed proper handling in Next.js.
   - Completed the Contact page 

# Future Improvements   
   - I would love to publish my website so after this semester ends I will look at hosting platforms that you guys recommended from class.
   - I want to work on the smaller things like animations for a longer period of time and also go from being a static project into a dynamic 
## Set up (For my own reference later)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
